### Release Highlights

This release contains GUI improvements (re-added Radar along with many options for it), text settings are more intuitive and easier to edit, along with other changes that will be more useful for future additions such as HighwayTools. There have also been many improvements such as switching to proper color settings for modules, new combat modules and future improvements that will improve compatibility among modules and other utility mods. Several weird bugs have also been fixed, along with one crash to keep with our "no known crash issues" policy.

Please provide feedback so we can improve the project even more for the next release!
This release is a little smaller than usual because we're focusing on quality of life improvements and polish, along with the upcoming **Plugin Developer Kit**, which we aim to release very soon.

Be sure to grab this release from [download](download) and leave feedback on future improvements ðŸ™‚
