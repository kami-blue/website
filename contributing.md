### Contributing 

To set up your development environment, make use of the following instructions:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules {{ site.github.repository_url }}
```

#### Import KAMI Blue into your IDE of choice. 

If you use Intellij, import the `build.gradle` file

If you use Eclipse, import a new gradle project and select the `kamiblue` folder. 

If you do not wish to run from an IDE, use `./gradlew runClient` to run KAMI Blue 
(not recommended due to random issues. run `./gradlew clean` if you experience any with it)

#### Running in Intellij IDEA

1. Wait for the Gradle import to finish. 
2. In the Gradle tab, hit the reimport ðŸ”„ button. If you don't see the Gradle tab on the very right of Intellij, go to File -> Close Project, and then reopen the project. 
Make sure your workspace is setup as per above, and then hit reimport ðŸ”„ inside Gradle.
3. Expand the tab -> expand `Forgegradle`
4. Run `setupDecompWorkspace` and wait for it to finish
5. Run `genIntellijRuns`
6. Reimport ðŸ”„ Gradle and then restart Intellij
7. You'll see a `Minecraft Client`. Select it, and hit edit.
8. Change the classpath to `folderName.main`
9. You can now just hit the green play button to open Minecraft with your current changes

#### Running in Eclipse

You'll have to execute the `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` and `./gradlew eclipse` commands before doing anything. 
Then, restart Eclipse and run Minecraft Client.

### Building

***

#### Linux

You can build by running these commands (without the <>) in a terminal.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules {{ site.github.repository_url }} kamiblue && cd kamiblue
./gradlew build
```

To use the built jar, find a file in `build/libs` called `<folderName>-<kamiVersion>-release.jar` which you can copy to the `mods` folder of a Minecraft instance that has Forge 1.12.2 installed.

***

#### Windows

0. Make sure you have [Oracle JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) installed first. 
1. Navigate to where you downloaded KAMI Blue, open the folder, and in the file path, double click to open the full file path. 
2. Type `cmd` and hit enter.
3. This will open `cmd` with the current directory (`cd`) being the KAMI Blue folder. Now type `gradlew.bat build`
4. and hit enter. 

To use the built jar, find a file in `build/libs` called `<folderName>-<kamiVersion>-release.jar` which you can copy to the `mods` folder of a Minecraft instance that has Forge 1.12.2 installed.
