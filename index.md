### Status

This was in active development. When issues are being closed is by milestone, and bugs are higher priority, though there aren't any bugs that break something completely.

    See <a href="https://github.com/fr1kin/forgehax">forgehax</a> for an equivalent. Some features in KAMI may be based on those of forgehax, and KAMI / KAMI Blue have some features it doesn't. KAMI Blue won't be based off of other mods unless said otherwise.

    If you get banned for breaking a servers rules using KAMI Blue, it is not any of the developers fault. It is meant to be used on *anarchy* servers, which do not have rules.
