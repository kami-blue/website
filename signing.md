## Signing

KAMI Blue is open source and publically auditable. You can view the full source code here: <{{ site.github.repository_url }}>

Commits are signed by both l1ving and iBuyMountainDew, with releases being published by l1ving. Both members have full write access to the organization, with both members having **2fa** protection on their Github Account. Nobody else has push access to any kami-blue repository. 

If a commit is not signed, it is **imperative** that you check the contents of the commit yourself, if you'd like to be sure it is safe (ie a pull request was merged without signed commits). 

Keep in mind, the likelyhood of having a Github account with **2fa** and proper password security being hacked is extremely low. L1ving uses a 12 word + special characters standard, with a physical 2fa key, which is virtually uncrackable in the heat death of the universe, along with Github hashing the password, and the commits being signed by **4096 bit RSA**, with iBuyMountainDew using similar security

## Verifying 

First import L1ving's public key with this command

```bash
curl https://kamiblue.org/pgp.asc | gpg --import
````

Then download both the release and signature files (below). 

Then you run this command in a directory with both of the downloaded files. 

```bash
gpg --verify KAMI-Blue-{{  site.cur_ver  }}-release.jar.sig
```

Keep in mind this requires you have gnupg or an alternative installed. 

You should get an output similar to this 

```bash
gpg: assuming signed data in 'KAMI-Blue-{{  site.cur_ver  }}-release.jar'
gpg: Signature made Sat Jun  6 04:20:00 2020 EDT
gpg:                using RSA key F0BC7BF440E30845DFCC4BC5B4A5A6DCA70F861F
gpg: Good signature from "Dominika Sokolov <sokolov.dominika@gmail.com>" [ultimate]
```

If you don't get "Good signature", or it isn't signed by `F0BC7BF440E30845DFCC4BC5B4A5A6DCA70F861F` then you should **NOT** use this release, it means it's been hijacked (or more likely, l1ving forgot to sign it properly, but it's better to be safe then sorry)

You will get a message saying "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!". This just means that not enough trusted people have publically signed my (l1ving's) key to verify that I am a real person. As long as the key matches the https://keybase.io/l1ving profile, then it's mine. Feel free to help out by signing my key!
