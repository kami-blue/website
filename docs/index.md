### A Minecraft utility mod for anarchy servers

This is an open source project written primarily by 086 and S-B99. It has many useful combat and general utilities to assist the player. 

See the [FAQ](/docs/docs/faq.html) pages for information about using the mod itself, and the [modules](/docs/docs/modules.html) page for information about the 100 unique modules this has.

This project was started by 086 in early 2018, and it gained popularity for having the best CrystalAura.
In late 2019 S-B99 picked up the project as 086 does not intend to actively maintain 1.12.2, instead focusing on making a fabric 1.14.4 version.

Due to the tidy codebase and how easy it is to create your own modules, many forks and private skids based on KAMI and KAMI Blue, more recently, have been created. 
The community as a whole appreciates everyone who has contributed to the open source KAMI and KAMI Blue.

### Status 

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/S-B99/kamiblue/issues/) page for planned features and bugs.

This is currently in active development. When issues are being closed is by milestone, and bugs are higher priority, though there aren't any bugs that break something completely.

<p>This is by no means a finished project, nor is it a "cheat" or "hack" for anything, it is a <i>utility</i> mod.

See <a href="https://github.com/fr1kin/forgehax">forgehax</a> for an equivalent. Some features in KAMI may be based on those of forgehax, and KAMI / KAMI Blue have some features it doesn't. KAMI Blue won't be based off of other mods unless said otherwise.</p>
